## Summary 

Sudoku solver in vanilla Javascript, html and css. I solved it using DFS but I actually was inspired to write this because I watched the Sudoku Solver video on the Computerphile Youtube channel. So in the end even though I could've thought of using a search algorithm to solve it, since they directly talked about it I used a very similar method.

## Background
